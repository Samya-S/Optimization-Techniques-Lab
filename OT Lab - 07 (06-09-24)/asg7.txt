Write code for Big M method. Address Unbounded solution, No solution, the existence of alternate solution, degeneracy, break degeneracy, If yes break degeneracy and find solution.

Output:
Unbounded/Alternate/No solution and degeneracy occurs or not.
Basic feasible solution at each iteration
Objective value at each iteration
Minimum ratio and Pivot element at each iteration
Optimal solution and  Optimal value
